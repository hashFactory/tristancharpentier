<h1 class="content-title">Hello</h1>

<p>This is my homepage</p>

<p>Feel free to explore but some tabs may be broken and certainly not mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>btw the color scheme of the page changes depending on your system dark mode toggle</p>
<p>just warning the Music tab contains my mixes and will use a bunch of data to load the files so don't click while on cellular (~200MB)</p>
